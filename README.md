# Mini-Project-1
------------------
## Group Members : Jonathan Martinez, Cindy Wong, Mylene Marsden, Christian Torres

------------------
### Objective
Looking at the historical stock price and returns of the S&P500 stock market index, analyse the performance of its economic sectors in periods of crisis for the last 20 years (2003 – 2023). Then, research what happened in those negative years and identify whether the affected sectors could recover after the crisis. Finally, explore the trends of each sector and their current weight on the index, based on average returns and market capitalisation, to suggest the sectors/companies that are up-trending and potentially worth of investment.
BONUS: Identify the correlation between the S&P500 returns, and inflation rate for goods and services (CPI) in the United States.

-------------------
### Audience
Our target audience is someone who is looking to invest in the stock market and would like to reduce the risk by having some insights about the behaviour of the economic sectors in the United States based on the S&P500. 

-------------------
### Timeframe and figures
20 years of historical data (Monthly/Yearly Returns and Stock Price). From January 2003 to January 2023 (year today)

-------------------
### Understanding S&P500
The S&P 500 Index, or Standard & Poor's 500 Index, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S. It covers approximately 80% of available marker capitalisation. In other words, S&P500 tracks the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States and it is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.

-------------------
### Content
1. What is the S&P500 and why it is important in the US stock market.

Bonus calculator: What would have happend if you were invested $10,000 in this index 20 years ago? - How much you would have today?. Now, how muh you would have if you invested $10,000 20 years ago, plus you contributed an extra $500 per month over the 20 years?.
3. Years of negative return of the S&P500 and its causes. **Graph: Bar chart (positive return format with green colour, negative return fromat with red colour)**.
4. Analysis of the stock price of the economic sectors in periods of negative return. Compare year prior the crisis, year of the crisis, year after the crisis. Example: 2008 Housing Prices crisis, compare stock price per sector in 2007, 2008, 2009. Years of negative return identified 2008, 2015, 2018, 2022. **Graph: Horizontal Bars grouped by sector comparing the 3 years. **
5. Tred of the stock price of each S&P500 economic sector per year. **Graph: Line plot**.
6. Performance of the secotrs based on percentage of return in the last 5 years (2018 - 2020). **Graph: Pie Chart OR Line Plot**. Identify Top 3 outperforming sectors and Top 3 underperforming sectors.
7. Current percentage participation by weitgh of market capitalisation of each sector in the S&P500 index (sector breakdown). **Graph: Pie Chart**. Group by sector based on the sum of market cap.

BONUS: Correlation between the S&P500 returns, and inflation rate for goods and services (CPI) in the United States. **Graph: Scatter Plot** & **Statistics**
