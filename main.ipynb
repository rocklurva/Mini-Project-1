    "\n",
    "##### The S&P 500 Index, or Standard & Poor's 500 Index, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S. It covers approximately 80% of available market capitalisation. In other words, S&P500 tracks the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States and it is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) is the most commonly used benchmark for determining the state of the overall economy. Many investors also use the S&P 500 as a benchmark for their individual portfolios. The key advantage of using the S&P 500 as a benchmark is the wide market breadth of the large-cap companies included in the index. The index can provide a broad view of the economic health of the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### It represents the stock market's performance by reporting the risks and returns of the biggest companies. Investors usually look at the S&P 500 to assess how the overall stock market is doing. This index is considered a leading U.S. economic indicator.\n",
